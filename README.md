# NextJS Minimal Markdown Blog Template

This project is a starter template for a minimal markdown blog built with NextJS 13, and Tailwind & ContentLayer.

Live Demo: https://next-mdx-blog-six.vercel.app/

## Features
At this moment, this project is a very simple Markdown (MDX) blog. Here is a list of the current features, as well as my wishlist:

Current Features
- Beautiful Minimal and Responsive Theme using TailwindCSS
- Styled Markdown using ContentLayer, remarkGfm and reHype
- Type-safe markdown Post and Page types.
- Pagination
- List of recent posts on the homepage
- ContentLayer Markdown with remarkGfm
- Tag Cloud: Dynamic Pages & Tag Cloud that renders a list of posts by tag.
- Markdown Compiled on Hot reload

## Features Wishlist

This is a project I'll probably be adding onto overtime. Here are a couple of features I would like to implement, in no particular order:

- Mobile Togglable Menu
- Basic Set of UI Components: Buttons, Inputs, etc.
- Searchbar: To find blog posts better accross the site.
- Dark Mode Toggle: For the sake of our eyes!
- Markdown Internal Links: Something in the style of Obsidian: `[[]]`

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for considering my online vocal recording services! I'm excited to work with you and help bring your music to life. To ensure that we're on the same page, here's a comprehensive guide that covers how online live recording sessions with me work, what you can expect from me, and how to get set up. So, let's dive in!

## Scheduling

To get started, we'll need to find a suitable time for our live session. I'm available for sessions before 8 PM in my local time (EET, Helsinki time) on most weekdays. Weekend session can occasionally be arranged to accommodate timezone differences.

Once we agree on a time, you can either place an order directly, or I can send you a custom order to get things rolling smoothly.

## Pricing & Time Estimate

Typically, we'll start with booking a 1-hour session and add extra time as needed. The studio time required for a project depends on various factors, such as the complexity of the song and the number of vocal tracks involved. Here's a table of the typical studio time required for vocal projects:

| Project                                      | Studio Time |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| One section of vocals or only some harmonies | 1h or less  |
| Lead vocals for a \~4 minutes song           | 1h30        |
| Lead vocals & harmony for a \~4 minutes song | 2-3h        |

Keep in mind that each project is different, and the studio time needed depends mostly on your vision, and how well prepared you are.

You can help the session run smoothly by providing clearly labeled files (backing tracks and guide vocals), guide vocals with the words for synchronization, MIDI files for melodies and harmonies (if available), separate stems for guide harmonies, and sheet music if you have it. The more prepared we are, the more efficiently we can work together!

For my current session hourly pricing, please refer to my [Fiverr Gig Page](https://www.fiverr.com/elvannabendroth/record-operatic-vocals-or-harp-for-your-song?funnel=92d83970769c4ff9507bf78b2fcb2259).

## Composition & Arrangement

If you need assistance with writing melodies, lyrics, or arrangements before the recording session, I offer consultation calls.

During these calls, we can discuss your requirements and come up with creative solutions to enhance your music. During that time you'll have access to my professional expertise in composition, lyrics writing, music theory and arrangement skills.

The hourly rate for consultation calls are half of my studio hourly rate. Please refer to my [Fiverr Gig Page](https://www.fiverr.com/elvannabendroth/record-operatic-vocals-or-harp-for-your-song?funnel=92d83970769c4ff9507bf78b2fcb2259) for current pricings.

## Studio Session & Delivery

When you hire me for a recording session, my hourly studio rate includes session and file preparation, as well as editing of the final takes after the recording. I will deliver fully edited files in raw .WAV format without any effects.

During the session, your are highly encouraged to give me feedback on the performance. I'm always happy to can try different delivery styles and vocal arrangements until you are happy with the result. Live feedback is precisely what makes live recording sessions so great!

The completed files will be delivered to you in .WAV format and without effect within a couple days of our session and will be ready for you to seamlessly incorporate into your project!

## Getting Ready for The Session

To facilitate the best audio quality and real-time streaming during our session, I use [Source-Connect](https://www.source-elements.com/products/source-connect/). This web application allows us to have a high-quality audio connection and stream stereo audio. Before the session, I will send you the Source-Connect room link and password through Discord or Fiverr. To ensure a smooth experience, please make sure you have Google Chrome installed and test your audio setup in advance.

For general communication, screen sharing, and as a backup in case of routing issues, I use Discord. Feel free to add me on Discord with the username "Elvann." This way, we can stay connected and address any technical or communication-related concerns that may arise.

I hope this guide provides you with a clear understanding of how our online recording sessions will work. If you have any further questions or need clarification on any aspect, don't hesitate to reach out.

Looking forward to creating awesome music together! ðŸ¤˜

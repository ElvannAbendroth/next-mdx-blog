At this moment, this project is a very simple Markdown (MDX) blog build with NextJS, TailwindCSS and ContentLayer.  I have plans to add features to this project overtime.  Here is a list of the current features, as well as my wishlist.

## Current Features
- Beautiful Minimal and Responsive Theme using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Styled Markdown using ContentLayer, remarkGfm and reHype
- Type-safe markdown Post and Page types.
- List of recent posts on the homepage
- ContentLayer Markdown with remarkGfm
- Tag Cloud: Dynamic Page that renders a list of posts by tag. `/tags/[slug]`
- Markdown Compiled on Hot reload

## Features Wishlist

This is a project I'll probably be adding onto overtime.  Here are a couple of features I would like to implement, in no particular order:
- Pagination: for better display of blog posts.
- Search feature: To find blog posts better accross the site.
- Dark Mode Toggle: For the sake of our eyes!
- Markdown Internal Links: Something in the style of Obsidian: `[[]]`
- Tag Cloud: Page with a list of all of the existing tags. "/tags"

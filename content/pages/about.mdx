Hey hi, I'm [Oodri](http://www.oodri.dev) ðŸ¤˜ I'm a web developer and a [musician](http://www.elvann.com) with a lot of ideas in mind.


I created this minimal static markkown blog as a way to learn and experiement with [NextJS 13](https://nextjs.org/) and the new app router.  NextJS is a modern Framework for web developement build on top of React and based on server components.

This project is very barebone for the moment, but I'm planning to add features to it over time.  Please feel free to use this as a starter template for your own projects! The source code is available [here on my Github](https://github.com/ElvannAbendroth/next-mdx-blog).

## Features Wishlist

This is a project I'll probably be adding onto overtime.  Here are a couple of features I would like to implement, in no particular order:
- Pagination: for better display of blog posts.
- Search feature: To find blog posts better accross the site.
- Dark Mode Toggle: For the sake of our eyes!
- Tag Cloud: Searching related posts by tag shared.
- Markdown Internal Links: Something in the style of Obsidian: `[[]]`

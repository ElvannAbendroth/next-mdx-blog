Hey hi, I'm [Oodri](http://www.oodri.dev) ðŸ¤˜I'm a web developer and a [musician](http://www.elvann.com) with a creative mind!


I created this minimal static markdown blog as a way to learn and experiement with [NextJS 13](https://nextjs.org/) and the new app router.  NextJS is a modern Framework for web developement build on top of React and based on server components.

This project is very barebone for the moment, but I'm planning to add features to it over time.  Please feel free to use this as a starter template for your own projects! The source code is available [here on my Github](https://github.com/ElvannAbendroth/next-mdx-blog).

[Visit the Features page](/features) for more information on this blog features, as well as what I hope to add in the future.
